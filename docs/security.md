# Nexus HTTP Server Security Documentation

## Overview

The Nexus HTTP Server includes multiple built-in security features designed to protect against common web application vulnerabilities. This document explains these features and how to configure them.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication

The server supports two authentication methods:

1. **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication for API endpoints
2. **API Key Authentication**: Alternative authentication method for machine-to-machine communication

### 2. Input Sanitization

All user inputs are automatically sanitized to prevent:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- SQL injection attacks
- Path traversal attacks
- Other injection vulnerabilities

### 3. Rate Limiting

IP and user-based rate limiting prevents abuse:
- 1000 requests per hour per IP address
- 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user

### 4. Security Headers

The server automatically adds security headers to all responses:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- And more...

### 5. Intrusion Detection

Pattern matching detects and blocks common attack vectors:
- XSS patterns
- SQL injection patterns
- Directory traversal attempts
- Code injection attempts

### 6. PII Redaction

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is automatically redacted from logs:
- Social Security Numbers
- Email addresses
- And other sensitive data patterns

### 7. Security Logging

Dedicated security event logging to `security.log` for monitoring and auditing.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `NEXUS_API_KEYS`: Comma-separated list of valid API keys
- `DEV_MODE`: Set to `False` for production deployments
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key (auto-generated if not set)

### Security Settings

In `nexus_server/config.py`:
```python
DEV_MODE = False  # Set to False for production
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB limit
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Production Deployment

1. Set `DEV_MODE = False` in configuration
2. Use a strong, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY`
3. Configure proper SSL/TLS for HTTPS
4. Regularly update dependencies
5. Run security scans using `make security`

### 2. API Key Management

1. Generate strong, random API keys
2. Store API keys securely (environment variables, not in code)
3. Regularly rotate API keys
4. Revoke compromised keys immediately

### 3. Monitoring

1. Regularly check `security.log` for suspicious activity
2. Set up alerts for security events
3. Monitor rate limiting logs
4. Audit API key usage

## Security Testing

The server includes automated security tests in `security_tests.py` that verify:
- Rate limiting functionality
- XSS detection
- SQL injection detection

Run security tests with:
```bash
make security-test
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do not publicly disclose the issue
2. Contact the maintainers directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure

## Compliance

The Nexus HTTP Server helps with compliance requirements for:
- GDPR (data protection)
- HIPAA (healthcare data)
- PCI DSS (payment data)
- And other regulatory frameworks

Note: Compliance requires proper configuration and usage of the server.
