## Overview

Nexus HTTP Server implements cutting-edge privacy-preserving technologies alongside traditional security measures to protect both data in transit and at rest. The server incorporates:

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Differential privacy for statistical analysis
- Traditional security measures like JWT authentication and rate limiting

## Encryption Features

### End-to-End Encryption

The server implements robust end-to-end encryption using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms:

- **PBKDF2** for key derivation from passwords
- **AES-256** via **Fernet** for symmetric encryption
- **Base64** encoding for safe transmission

#### Key Features:

1. **Password-Based Key Derivation**: Uses PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive strong cryptographic keys from user passwords
2. **Salt Generation**: Automatically generates unique 16-byte salts for each encryption operation to prevent rainbow table attacks
3. **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses Fernet (AES 128 in CBC mode with HMAC for authentication)
4. **Safe Encoding**: Base64 encodes encrypted data and salts for safe JSON transmission

#### Usage Example:

```bash
# Encrypt data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/encrypt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": "Secret Message", "password": "strongpassword123"}'

# Decrypt data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/decrypt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "encrypted_data": "eyJkYXRhIjogIk15IGVuY3J5cHRlZCBkYXRhIiwgInNhbHQiOiAiTVdVek1EST0ifQ==", 
    "salt": "TVdVek1EST0=", 
    "password": "strongpassword123"
  }'
```

## Differential Privacy Features

Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that provides strong privacy guarantees for statistical analysis. The server implements:

### Laplace Mechanism

The core of differential privacy in Nexus is the Laplace mechanism, which adds calibrated noise to statistical queries.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **ε (Epsilon)**: Privacy budget parameter
   - Smaller ε = stronger privacy, more noise
   - Larger ε = weaker privacy, less noise
   - Typical values: 0.01-10.0

2. **Sensitivity**: Maximum change in query output when one record is added/removed
   - For counting queries: 1
   - For sum queries: Depends on data range

3. **Noise Scale**: Determined by sensitivity/ε

#### Implemented Algorithms:

1. **DP Count**: Differentially private count of records
2. **DP Mean**: Differentially private mean calculation with ε budget splitting

#### Usage Example:

```bash
# Differentially private count
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dp/count \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "values": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
    "epsilon": 1.0
  }'

# Differentially private mean
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dp/mean \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "values": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 
    "epsilon": 1.0
  }'
```

## Traditional Security Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained access control
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling

### Input Sanitization and Validation

- **Recursive Sanitization**: Cleans all user inputs to prevent XSS, SQLi, and path traversal
- **Schema Validation**: Validates JSON request bodies against defined schemas
- **Content-Type Checking**: Validates content types for proper handling

### Rate Limiting

- **IP-Based Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse from single sources
- **User-Based Rate Limiting**: Applies limits to authenticated users
- **Adaptive Throttling**: Adjusts limits based on server load

### Security Headers

Automatically adds crucial HTTP security headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`
- Configurable `Content-Security-Policy`

### Intrusion Detection

- **Pattern Matching**: Detects common attack patterns
- **Suspicious Activity Logging**: Logs potential security incidents
- **Real-Time Blocking**: Blocks detected threats

### Logging and Auditing

- **Separate Security Logs**: Dedicated `security.log` for security events
- **PII Redaction**: Automatically removes sensitive information from logs
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Tracks all server activities

## Best Practices

### For Application Developers

1. **Always Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted in transit
2. **Strong Password Policies**: Encourage users to use strong passwords for encryption
3. **Appropriate Epsilon Values**: Choose epsilon values based on privacy requirements
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs before processing
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep the server updated with security patches

### For Data Protection

1. **Minimize Data Collection**: Only collect data that is absolutely necessary
2. **Data Retention Policies**: Implement clear policies for data retention and deletion
3. **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls for sensitive data
4. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents

### For Privacy Preservation

1. **Differential Privacy Budgeting**: Carefully manage epsilon budgets across queries
2. **Data Minimization**: Apply differential privacy to aggregated statistics only
3. **User Consent**: Obtain proper consent for data processing activities
4. **Transparency**: Be transparent about data processing and privacy measures
5. **Privacy Impact Assessments**: Conduct assessments for new features
