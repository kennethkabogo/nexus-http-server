# Production Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

1. A Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
2. Docker and Docker Compose installed
3. Domain name (optional but recommended)
4. SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus-http-server.git
cd nexus-http-server
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the example:

```bash
cp examples/.env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your production settings:

```bash
# .env
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
DEV_MODE=False
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-here
```

### 3. Build and Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Set Up Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

Create an Nginx configuration file:

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/nexus-server
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nexus-server /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 5. SSL Certificate with Let's Encrypt

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

### 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

Check logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Update the server:

```bash
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Privacy-Preserving Features in Production

When deploying to production, consider these privacy-preserving features:

### End-to-End Encryption

The server provides built-in encryption endpoints that can be used to protect sensitive data:

- `/api/encrypt` - Encrypts data before storing or transmitting
- `/api/decrypt` - Decrypts data when needed

These endpoints use industry-standard AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation.

### Differential Privacy

For applications that perform statistical analysis, the server provides differentially private endpoints:

- `/api/dp/count` - Provides privacy-preserving counts
- `/api/dp/mean` - Provides privacy-preserving means

These endpoints add calibrated noise to protect individual privacy while preserving statistical accuracy.

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

The server supports zero-knowledge encryption where the server never sees plaintext data or encryption keys:

- `/api/zk/generate-key` - Generate client-side encryption keys
- `/api/zk/prepare-storage` - Prepare data for zero-knowledge storage
- `/api/zk/retrieve-storage` - Retrieve and decrypt data from storage

### Privacy Budget Management

For applications that perform multiple differential privacy queries, the server provides privacy budget management:

- `/api/privacy/budget` - Get current privacy budget status
- `/api/privacy/budget/consume` - Manually consume privacy budget
- `/api/privacy/budget/reset` - Reset privacy budget

### Data Expiration and Self-Destruction

For applications that handle sensitive temporary data, the server provides automatic data expiration:

- `/api/data/expiration` - Get information about expiring data
- `/api/data/expiration/<data_id>/extend` - Extend data expiration
- `/api/data/expiration/<data_id>/cancel` - Cancel data expiration

### Federated Learning

For applications that need privacy-preserving machine learning, the server provides federated learning capabilities:

- `/api/fl/initialize` - Initialize global model structure
- `/api/fl/start-round` - Start a new federated learning round
- `/api/fl/submit-update` - Submit client model updates
- `/api/fl/aggregate` - Aggregate client updates to improve global model

## Scaling Considerations

For high-traffic applications, consider:

1. Using a production-grade WSGI server like Gunicorn
2. Adding a load balancer
3. Using a CDN for static assets
4. Implementing database persistence
5. Setting up automated backups
6. Configuring proper rate limiting for privacy-preserving endpoints
7. Monitoring privacy budget consumption in high-usage applications
8. Implementing data expiration policies for sensitive data
9. Using distributed systems for federated learning coordination in large deployments
